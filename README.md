# Abstract
Package confeito provides fast ensemble tree inference.
See documents on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/hiro4bbh/confeito) for details.

This package is based on QuickScorer __[Lucchese+ 2015]__.
We confirmed that the QuickScorer-based implementation is >4x faster than the naive implementation on 65536 depth-12 trees with 65536D sparse feature.
